# Introduction
In this project we will discover the world of raycasting, a powerful technique that converts a 2D environment into 3D visuals. As a student of computer graphics, raycasting plays a key role in crafting immersive environments. My exploration of this technique began with this project, which I and my peer @Sstarcourge developed during our time at 1337MED School. In this project, weâ€™ll explore the core principles of a raycasting engine, break down the implementation of cub3D, and reflect on the lessons I learned throughout the journey. Join us as we dive into the fascinating mechanics of raycasting and the dynamic virtual worlds it creates.
